# Automated website navigation

Selenium is a package designed for background browser control, allowing you to automate interactions with websites.

This also uses some basic HTML navigation to select webpage elements.

Also makes use of automated authentications, python's keyring package, and cookie loading.

This project works properly, but was abandoned before it could be refined because I realised it could be used to breach terms of service.
